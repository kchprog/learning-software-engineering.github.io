## Introduction

### What is shadcn/ui? ðŸ¤”

Shadcn/ui gives you the ability to use re-usable components that are built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. You are able to choose from their collection of pre-built components, copy and paste the code into your project, and then customize them using cva variants.

You may also use shadcn/ui to build your own components library.

Shadcn/ui helps you separate the design of your components from the implementation. This way, using shadcn/ui can also help speed up the time spent on designing your components.
