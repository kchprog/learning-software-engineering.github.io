## Introduction

### What is shadcn/ui? ðŸ¤”

[Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) gives you the ability to use re-usable components that are built using [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). You are able to choose from their collection of pre-built components, add the code into your project, and then customize them using cva variants.

### What to Expect ðŸ“„

This document will go over how to install and integrate shadcn/ui into your project. Then, it will go through an example of building a `Button` component into your project and talk through the details in each step.

## Installation

You can use shadcn/ui components in any framework that supports React. Typescript is recommended for your projects but Javascript components are also available by making changes to your configurations.

Follow the link below depending on the framework you are using for your project:

- [Next.js](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next)
- [Vite](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/vite)
- [Remix](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/remix)
- [Gatsby](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/gatsby)

## Creating and Customizing Components

<!-- This [document](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/button) shows the steps you need to take in order to install and use a `Button` component in your project.  -->

Follow these steps to install, use, and customize a `Button` component in your own project:

1. **Installation:** Add the `Button` component to your project

   ```bash
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
   ```

   This will add a `button.tsx` file into `components/ui`.

   #### button.tsx

   ```Typescript
   import * as React from "react"
   import { Slot } from "@radix-ui/react-slot"
   import { cva, type VariantProps } from "class-variance-authority"

   import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"

   const buttonVariants = cva(
   "inline-flex items-center justify-center whitespace-nowrap rounded-md text-sm font-medium ring-offset-background transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50",
   {
       variants: {
       variant: {
           default: "bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90",
           destructive:
           "bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground hover:bg-destructive/90",
           outline:
           "border border-input bg-background hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",
           secondary:
           "bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80",
           ghost: "hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground",
           link: "text-primary underline-offset-4 hover:underline",
       },
       size: {
           default: "h-10 px-4 py-2",
           sm: "h-9 rounded-md px-3",
           lg: "h-11 rounded-md px-8",
           icon: "h-10 w-10",
       },
       },
       defaultVariants: {
       variant: "default",
       size: "default",
       },
   }
   )

   export interface ButtonProps
   extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>,
       VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants> {
   asChild?: boolean
   }

   const Button = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>(
   ({ className, variant, size, asChild = false, ...props }, ref) => {
       const Comp = asChild ? Slot : "button"
       return (
       <Comp
           className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant, size, className }))}
           ref={ref}
           {...props}
       />
       )
   }
   )
   Button.displayName = "Button"

   export { Button, buttonVariants }

   ```

2. **Usage:** Import the `Button` component in your project wherever you need to use it.

   ```Typescript
   import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
   ```

3. **Customization:** Add the imported component in your project and customize it however you like. See [examples](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/button#examples) of how to use the different variants defined in [button.tsx](#buttontsx) to style your component in different ways.

   #### Customizing Using Variants

   The variants given to you in the file is named according to the colours that are defined in your main css file during installation.

   You can make changes to the default variants with Tailwind to fit your project's theme.

   You can also rename the variants and add your own variants to create more customization in your component.

   To apply a certain variant to your component, all you need to do is define the variant property to your used component:

   ```Typescript
   <Button variant="outline">Click here</Button>
   ```

   #### Customizing the Size

   Sizing of the component can be customized to easily create responsive designs. Similar to variants, you can customize different sizes in the component file and use them in your project:

   ```Typescript
   <Button variant="outline" size="lg">Click here</Button>
   ```

   Similar to variants, you can rename the default sizes or add your own.

See the shadcn/ui [documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/accordion) to see all the components that are available to re-use in your project.
